# Yo Zekie and Inigo! Welcome to our First Project

Don't **fret** because we have room for error

Just Familiarize with github, git, java and everything we will be doing as

a team here in this space

* Shoot yo ideas
* No idea is wrong or right
* No hate


# For checking code

* Align what needs to be aligned in the body of code
* Create functions/methods that could make the code less repetitive
* add comment
* change variables to readable variables (cover the lines of code as a test and see if u still understand the vars)
* reduce string literals and create utility class
* remove redundant variables (will i be using it more than once? does it help with the logical intent)

# So it begins sir
